                  Choosing a crypto wallet depends on your needs. Security,
                  custodianship, and interacting with smart contracts are key
                  points to consider. You also may want to access your wallet on
                  different devices.
                </p>
                <p className="text-font mt-5">
                  For browser extension wallets, MetaMask, MathWallet, and
                  Binance Chain Wallet are good options. If you prefer a mobile
                  experience, MetaMask, MathWallet, Trust Wallet and SafePal are
                  available for iOS and Android. They’re decentralized and store
                  your private key on your device. SafePal also offers a cold
                  storage hardware wallet for anyone looking for the highest
                  security. Apart from the hardware version, all crypto wallets
                  mentioned are free to use.

                </p>
                <p className="text-font">
                  Before you choose a specific wallet, think about what you
                  need. There’s more than just one type of wallet out there.
                  Most BSC wallets will be non-custodial, meaning you have
                  control of your private key. BSC wallets are also typically
                  hot wallets that allow you to quickly connect to DApps or
                  start staking. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages.
                </p>
                <p className="text-font mt-5">
                  1. Custodial - The wallet provider holds your private key.
                  This is the case with your digital assets in an exchange’s
                  wallet. Without owning your private key, you aren’t entirely
                  in control of your wallet. Likely, you won’t be able to
                  connect to DApps either. For example, if you only want to spot
                  trade BSC tokens and other cryptoassets, a custodial wallet is
                  a reasonable choice. But be careful. While this is safe to do
                  on Binance, you should not trust your funds to any custodial
                  wallet or exchange.
                </p>

                  <img src={StandAloneBannerImage} className="img-fluid " />
                </div>
                <p className="text-font mb-5">
                  2. Non-custodial - You own your private keys. It’s the safest
                  option for most traders and investors, as long as they take
                  good care of their keys and seed phrases. The wallets we’ll
                  cover later are all non-custodial options that allow you to
                  interact with DApps.
                </p>
                <p className="text-font mb-5">
                  3. Hot wallets - These crypto wallets are connected to the
                  internet and are typically non-custodial (unless you’re using
                  a centralized exchange). Hot wallets are convenient for making
                  transactions but come with some security risks. Your private
                  key is held online with your public key and is usually
                  accessible with a user-set password. Like any
                  password-protected service, you could be hacked or phished. To
                  mitigate the risks, you should also use two-factor
                  authentication (2FA) methods.
                </p>
                <p className="text-font">
                  4. Cold wallet - You store your private key offline on
                  specialized hardware. This option is the most secure way to
                  hold your BSC tokens, but it’s often the most impractical
                  method for making transactions and interacting with DApps. You
                  can easily use a combination of the above to combine their
                  strengths. However, for day-to-day transactions and DeFi
                  applications, a non-custodial hot wallet is a robust and
                  flexible option. Let’s take a look at some of the most popular
                  options.
